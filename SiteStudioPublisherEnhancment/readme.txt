Note:
Please note, when adding a new website section, the custom section properties will not appear to be
updated until you have refreshed your site heirarchy.

When altering the value of a section property, it may take several minutes to update all dependent
content items and index them so they appear proper in search results, such as that used during the
SSP spidering.
